## Original poem

In Gotham once the Story goes  
A set of Wise-acres arose  
Skill'd in the great Politic Wheel  
Could pound a Magpie, drown an Eel  
With many things of worthy Note  
At present much too long to quote  
Their District was both Far and Wide  
Which not a little swell'd their Pride  
But above all that they possessed  
Was a fine Goose by all confessed  
A Rara Avis to behold  
Who laid each day an Egg of Gold  
This made them grow immensely rich  
Gave them an avaritious Itch  
The case belongs to many more  
They not contented with their Store  
Would Methods vague and strange pursue  
To make the Harmless Bird lay Two  
This glorious Purpose to obtain  
About her Neck they put a Chain  
And more their Folly to compleat  
They stampt upon her Wings and Feet  
But this had no Effect at all  
Yet made her Struggle Flutter, Squall  
And do as any Goose would do  
Who had her Liberty in view  
When One of more distuinguish'd Note  
Cried D**n her Let us Cut her Throat  
They did, but not an Egg was found  
But Blood came pouring from ye Wound
